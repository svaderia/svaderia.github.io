## TODO:

- [X] Make it easy to add new stuff to website. Add even small things in a folder called snippet. Inspired from [here](https://wincent.dev/snippets)
- [X] Make everything searchable. I want to keep writing only because I can quickly find the things I liked or the things I read and want to re-read again.[^1]
- [ ] Merge all the pages of experience into one, Basically Projects, Exeperience, Publication, etc.
- [ ] Port the old blogs from gujju coder website [GujjuCoders](https://github.com/svaderia/GujjuCoders/tree/master)
- [ ] Add competitive resources better on the website. Look at the repo for the ideas.
- [ ] Have an automated port from notion to the website. makes life easier (maybe)
- [ ] Let's have public TODO of things I want to do in life. Like [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challanges, or
  [pythonchallange](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/about.php), or the [distributed](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) challange, or the [notpron](http://www.notpron.com/notpron/),
  or [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), or the [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/about), or the [Bulid your own Redis](https://build-your-own.org/),
  or [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
  or [Anything Build your own]
- [ ] Try neovim. Try with the `0 to LSP` video on youtube. Optimize your plugins. Think about switching from vim to nvim.
   Do not overcomplicate by thininking about all the plugins available. Just be minimal. minimal plugins, minimal configs.
   Only reason it's tempting to move to nvim is because of `tree-sitter`. I feel that it would be so awesome to not worry about
   formatting and plugins for the new language I am trying to work into.
- [ ] You might need to update the repo to GitHub Actions, some references [1][11], [2][22]
- [ ] Update the favicon of the site
- [ ] Read about link rot, and do something for the pages you have bookmarked, or refered, or saved.[^2]
- [ ] Add Dark mode? [^3]
- [ ] Create the *Blogs I like* and *Books I read*, along with *Tools I use* 
- [ ] Change the *All* page to *Recent* page, and have a button there that points to *All* page.
- [ ] Add a new navigation on DSA page.
