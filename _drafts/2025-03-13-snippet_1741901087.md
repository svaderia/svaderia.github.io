Be fricking better at: 
1. The PC hardware. Know what kind of video tech we have, what are differnet
   hardware component inside an old or new PC.
2. Some timesharing Tooling. Tooling in general, be familiar with more
   interesting stuff. Basically how stuff works. So far we have tried to just
   hack together a bunch of shit. We should now try to do better.
