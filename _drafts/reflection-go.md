## What is Reflection
Put very simply, Reflection allows you to examine and manipulate the internal properties of an object at runtime. 
This can be particularly useful when the type of the object isn't known until the code is executed.

Imagine a scenario where the type of an object passed to your function is unknown at compile time. It could be a `string`, an `int`, or even a `binary` blob.
Based on the input type, you need to perform different actions at runtime. How would you handle this situation?

In another scenario, you might need to verify if the object passed to your function implements a specific method at runtime. Or, you might need to check if the object is a `struct` and contains a particular field. How would you accomplish these tasks?

The answer lies in Go's `reflect` package.[^1]

[^1]: Almost all the modern language support Reflection in some form and taste. I am choosing Go becuase I am most familiar with it.

## Why you would need it
### Usecase:


## How to do it in Go



## Some exmaple code


## Final excercise
As a final exercise, try building an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) library using reflection. This will give you hands-on experience with dynamic type handling and method invocation in Go.
