## 19 feb debugging session with Atto


AsyncRingtonePlayer does the sending. 

Clock App sends an RPC to somewhere, we believe below is the guy

* RingtonePlayer.java
frameworks/base/apckages/systemui/....../RingtonPlayer.java
      Searched with VolumeShaper

SystemUI - Okay, see here is the good stuff. this shit is playing the local
ringtone.

IN sysstem ui, there is no local media player when it's BFU, 
SO the thing just plays the fallback ringtone with a file descriptor. 
We don't know why the thing doesn't exist there.
