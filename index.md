I am currently pursuing *Masters of Science in Information Networking* at *Carnegie Mellon University*. 
Being a student again has been rejuvenating, and I am loving the freedom to explore and learn again. 

Before starting my master's program, I worked at *Goldman Sachs* for nearly three years and at Samsung R&D for roughly one and a half years.
I completed my undergradudate degree in Computer Science at the  Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani).


During my time as a computer engineer, I have poked into few fascinating fields of Computer Science,
such as Machine learning, Multiprocessor programming, software side of next generation 5G networks and most importantly DSA.
Nowadays in my free time I am focusing on increasing my understanding of different algorithms and data structures by participating in online competitions.

The logo of this website is an Order 2 pseudo-Hilbert curve; a basic block of space filling curve also known as Hilbert's curve.
Formally, space filling curve is a function that gives a bijective mapping from *1D* line to *2D* space.
I see myself mimicking the space filling curve in a totally different context, one who is trying to bridge the gaps in his knowledge.
That kind of justifies the name of this website in a poetic way.

I planned to make this website an extensive place to keep my notes and share my thoughts about things I find interesting, but blog format for sharing knowledge didn't quite worked out for me.
Very recently I came accross the concept of [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).
I indent to restructure this website and plan to start publishing my all WIP learning. Maybe I would write an article on how I plan to change my note taking approach.

PS: Check out this amazing explanation on [Hilbert's curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc) by Grant Sanderson.
