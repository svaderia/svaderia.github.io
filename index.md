I am a software engineer working on 5G Access solutions at Samsung R&D, Bangalore. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from BITS Pilani. 
I have an undying desire to code everything I come across, be it a simple script in python or a complex algorithm for scheduling the wireless data for your device. 
I love to see the theoretical ideas working in a real world situation. 

The logo of this website is an Order 2 pseudo-Hilbert curve; a basic block of space filling curve also known as Hilbert's curve. 
Formally, space filling curve is a function that gives a bijective mapping from *1D* line to *2D* space. 
I see myself mimicking the space filling curve in a totally different context, one who is trying to bridge the gaps in his knowledge.
That kind of justifies the name of this website in a poetic way.

During my time as a computer engineer, I have poked into few fascinating fields of Computer Science. Like Machine learning, Multiprocessor programming, software side of next generation 5G networks and most importantly DSA. Nowadays in my free time I am focusing on increasing my understanding of different algorithms and data structures by participating in online competitions.

I plan to make this website an extensive place to keep my notes and share my thoughts about things I find interesting.
