I am currently pursuing a *Master of Science in Information Networking* at *Carnegie Mellon University*. 
Being a student again has been rejuvenating, and I am loving the freedom to explore and learn again. 

Before starting my master's program, I worked at *Goldman Sachs* for about three years and at *Samsung R&D* for roughly one and a half years.
I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the  *Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani)*.

My interest have evolved over time, starting with Machine Learning during my undergrad and shifting to Computer Systems in grad school.
Nowadays I am really into computer systems, and CMU offers endless courses and opportunities to test myself.
I'm also passionate about Data Structures and Algorithms. I try to participate in online competitions, whenever I can, to deepen my understanding. 

The logo of this website is an Order 2 pseudo-[Hilbert curve][hc]; a basic block of space-filling curve also known as Hilbert's curve.
Formally, space-filling curve is a function that gives a bijective mapping from *1D* line to *2D* space.
I see myself mimicking the space-filling curve in a totally different context, as one who is trying to bridge the gaps in his knowledge.
That kind of justifies the name of this website in a poetic way.

I planned to make this website an extensive place to keep my notes and share my thoughts about things I find interesting, but the blog format for sharing knowledge didn't quite work out for me.
Very recently, I came across the concept of a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).
I intend to restructure this website and plan to start publishing all my WIP learning. Maybe I will write an article on how I plan to change my note-taking approach.
