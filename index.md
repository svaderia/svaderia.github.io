I am a second-year Master's student at the *Information Networking Institute* of *Carnegie Mellon University*.
I am currently pursuing my Master's thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Dave Andersen](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/).

Before starting my master's program, I worked at *Goldman Sachs* and *Samsung R&D* for approximately four and a half year.
I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from *Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani)* in 2019.

My interest have evolved over time, starting with Machine Learning during my undergrad and shifting to Computer Systems in grad school.
I have delved into Distributed Systems, Operating Systems and Systems research since joining CMU.
I'm also passionate about Data Structures and Algorithms. I try to participate in online competitions whenever I can.

Learning Rust, writing a compiler, contributing to a "real" OS and conducting
substential research are my goals until summer. 

The logo of this website is an Order 2 pseudo-[Hilbert curve][hc]; a basic block of space-filling curve also known as Hilbert's curve.
Formally, space-filling curve is a function that gives a bijective mapping from *1D* line to *2D* space.
I see myself mimicking the space-filling curve in a totally different context, as one who is trying to bridge the gaps in his knowledge.
That kind of justifies the name of this website in a poetic way.
