Git is very powerful tool which all of us going to use at some point of time.
While making this blog I faced some issues like forgetting syntax and option for particular git commands.
That prompts me to write this post.  
I'm going to write all commands and their description briefly, if needed.  

### Config
{% highlight bash %}
$ git config --global user.name "Shyamal vaderia"   
$ git config --global user.email vaderiashayamal@gmail.com  
$ git config --global core.editor "vim"  
$ git config --list 
{% endhighlight %}

### Staging, Commit and Status
{% highlight bash %}
$ git init 
$ git add .
$ git commit # Open the core.editor for a comprehensive commit
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git diff # Shows what you have changed but haven't staged
$ git diff --cached #Shows what has been staged but not commited
$ git staus
{% endhighlight %}

### Log : commit history
{% highlight bash %}
$ git log # Shows all of the previous commits in reverse order
$ git log --pretty=oneline # Shows commits on one line
$ git log --pretty=format:"%h : %an : %ar : %s"
#  %h - Abbreviated Hash  
#  %an - Authors Name
#  %ar - Date Changed
#  %s - First Line of Comment
$ git log --since=1.weeks # Show only changes in the last week
$ git log --since="2017-04-15" # Show changes since this date
$ git log --author="Shyamal Vaderia" # Changes made by author
$ git log --before="2017-04-20" # Changes made before this date
{% endhighlight %}

### Undoing a commit
Normally done if you forgot to stage a file, or to change the commit message.
{% highlight bash%}
$ git commit --amend
{% endhighlight %}
If you want to stage more file than you have committed previously, just stage
that files first than use this command and this will stage 
the file you forgot as well.  

### Unstage a file
When you want to unstage a file that you have staged.
{% highlight bash %}
$ git reset HEAD <file name>
{% endhighlight %}

### Remote 
{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote -v # list all the remotes and their URL
$ git push URL
$ git pull URL
$ git fetch URL
$ git clone URL
$ git remote rename origin <your wish> # rename the name of the remotes
{% endhighlight %}

### Tags
> I'm going to write about it only if someone needs to use it

### Branching
{% highlight bash %}
$ git branch newBranch # cCeates new branch
$ git checkout newBranch # Go to newBranch
$ git checkout -b newBranch # Same job as the above 2 commands
$ git branch # Shows all branches
$ git branch --merged # Shows all merged branches
$ git branch --no-merged # Shows unmerged branches
$ git branch -v # Shows all branches and their last commits
$ git branch -d newBranch # Deletes merged branches with this
$ git branch -D new # Deletes unmerged branches
$ git branch -m newBranchName # Renames a branch
$ git merge newBranch # Merge the branch version with the master
$ git mergetool # use to solve merge conflicts
{% endhighlight %}

### Rebasing
Rebasing moves a branch to a new ( master / base ) commit. 
This is also referred to as a fast forward merge. 
Just never rebase commits that has been pushed to remote 
repository.
{% highlight bash %}
$ git rebase master
{% endhighlight %}

### Reverting and Resetting
Some times you want to eliminate a previous commit, 
but you still want to keep the commit for integrity reasons.
Revert is usefull in this case.
{% highlight bash %}
$ git revert HEAD # You are back to where you started, but the commit was made
{% endhighlight %}
Reset eliminates previous commits and you can never get them back. 
You really should never use it actually.
{% highlight bash %}
$ git reset someFile 
#Removes a file from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged
$ git reset 
#Reset the staging area to match the most recent commit while leaving the working directory unchanged
$ git reset aCommit 
#Move back to this previous commit, reseting the staging area, but not the working directory
$ git reset --hard 
#Reset both the staging area and working directory to match the most recent commit
$ git reset --hard aCommit 
#Move back to the commit listed and change staging and working directory
{% endhighlight %}

### Clean
Clean removes untracked files from your directory and is undoable.
{% highlight bash %}
$ git clean -n # Shows which files will be removed
$ git clean -f # Remove untracked files
gir clean -df 
# Remove untracked files and untracked directories in the current directory
$ git reset --hard # Undoes changes on all tracked files
$ git clean -df # Removes all untracked files
{% endhighlight %}

### Misc 1
Sometimes it is very tedious to enter Username and Password for same repo again and again.
Here is a solution to that!
{% highlight bash %}
# Permanently authenticating with Git repositories
$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push https://github.com/repo.git
    Username for 'https://github.com': <USERNAME>
    Password for 'https://USERNAME@github.com': <PASSWORD>
{% endhighlight %}
### Misc 2
Suppose you are on the `master` branch and you would like to test if the `dev` branch can be merged without conflict into the `master`.
{% highlight bash %}
# In the master branch
$ git merge dev --no-ff --no-commit
{% endhighlight %}
After that, you will be able to know if there's a conflict or not.  
To return in a normal situation, just abort the merge:
{% highlight bash %}
$ git merge --abort
{% endhighlight %}

### End
So I guess I have covered most of the commands of git,
If you feel something is missing, add it to 
the file and send a pull request.  
You are free to add more commands related to git to this notes.
Cheers!
