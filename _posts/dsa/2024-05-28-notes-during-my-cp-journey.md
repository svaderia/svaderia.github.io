title: "Notes during my CP journey"

excerpt: "This will always be WIP"

I want to maintain this page to write small notes, and accumulate my thoughts while I am participating in CP.
I will try to keep this short, but no gurantees. 
It would contain some tricks I found good while solving problems, 
or some good blogs I read, 
or some good C++ tips, basically anything which I would like to rememeber in future.
{: .notice--info}

We will have 2 categories vaguely,  
1. Problems: Collection of good problems and what I learned from each.  
2. General: Any other general tips or notes.


Since I am starting this very recently, it will definetly not contain a note for everything.

## Problems

* [D. XORificator](https://codeforces.com/contest/1977/problem/D): Teaches you how to hash a state with the minimum collision probability.

## General
* You should analyse the invariants of a tree before coming up with a solution. [Example Problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/1975/problem/E)
* [CSES](https://cses.fi/) related notes are on [CSES Notes](/dsa/cses) page.
