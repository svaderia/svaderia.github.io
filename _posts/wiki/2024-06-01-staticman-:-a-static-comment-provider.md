Long time ago, when I first created this website I was researching how to add comments in the blogs. 
Though I don't think comments are required for what I write on this website, I am no professional writer.  

I came across [ staticman ](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman). It's a very cool project which aims to 
maintain your dynamic contents, like comments, in a git repository. 

Basically you any new comments on the website becomes a new file in your git repository and gets committed. 
The build and deploy pipline for the GitHub pages will kick off. 
So now your site will be rebuilt and deployed with the comments. 


It's not instantaneous like other dynamic services, but what more can you hope to achieve on a static website. Pretty cool right?
