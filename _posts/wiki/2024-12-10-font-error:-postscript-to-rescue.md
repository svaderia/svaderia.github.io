Today while printing a paper, the printer gave me unknown font error!!

I went to preview in mac, saved the file as postscritp (`.ps`) and ran `ps2pdf`
from my command line. The new PDF prints. 

I wouldn't know the existence of post script if I didn't read the make file of
15410! 

They say "old is gold", today I agree.
