I wanted to download a video hosted on mediasite. 

I followed this guide on Reddit: [Downloading a lecture from Mediasite](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/8h9kfg/downloading_a_lecture_from_mediasitecom/).

Specifically, I used this tool: [MediasiteDownloader](https://github.com/KLVN/MediasiteDownloader).

One downside is that you can't download the slides; only the lecture video gets downloaded.
You would need to open the slides side by side and guess you are looking at the right slides. But I think it's limitation I could live with
