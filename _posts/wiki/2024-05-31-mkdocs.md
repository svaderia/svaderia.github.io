I used [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) to build a static site when I was working in Goldman Sachs to serve some internal documentation.

It seems to be in active development and serves the purpose quite well. It has a ton of plugins and themes to do the customisation. Something to keep in mind in future
