When you want to type `|` in a vim mapping, you need to use `<bar>` instead of `|` sign.
An example mapping can be :

```
nnoremap <Leader>r :terminal shell++ ./a.out <bar> beautifyLogs<CR>

This takes the output of a.out to a custom beautifyLogs utitlity, which will output a beautiful logs into a vim buffer and you can now scroll through it

```
