Snipping absolutely nothing :). Please forget this snip ever exited.

Just kidding.  
It was nice to read the docs for the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) after a while.
I came to know that Jekyll is mostly reaching the End Of Life, there seems to be less support. 
I also came to know that the theme was unmaintained for a while. Someone had again started the maintainance of the theme though.  
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) felt like a nice upgrade, but I don't think I want to spend time moving for now.
