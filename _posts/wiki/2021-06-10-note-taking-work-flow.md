 > THIS NEEDS REFINEMENT. THIS WERE MY RAW THOUGHTS AT THE TIME.

## A read it later app
I need to have a good read later app. There are two options here.
1. *Pocket*
      Free version has tags organisation, but limit you to only 3 highlights per article. The limit on highlight is annoying. But tags organisation is great to store articles I wanna find in future.
2. *Instapaper*
      Free version has folder structure. Limits you to 5 highlights per month. All the archived noted stays in only 1 folder. Which is annoying when you wanna find older articles.

I believe pocket wins by a margin because limiting myself to fewer highlights is good way to focus on important highlights. And organisation of article is important to not loose something you liked.

## Highlight importer

I need another highlight importer app. Basically the purpose of this app is to collect the highlights and notes from different sources(PDFs, Pocket, Web, etc.) in one place and then export this highlights to a format so that I can use it in my note taking.
1. *Readwise* is an amazing option here.
Didn’t find an alternative. This integrates with both pocket and instapaper. Can also get highlights from web, PDFs. The best feature is I can export this highlights + notes via API into
Markdown to integrate this with whatever note taking app I choose to use.

## Note taking application
Next I need an app to produce some meaningful content. It should integrate easily with SSG, so that I can publish it online.
1. *Obsidian*
This has rich set of plugin ecology. Good community I believe. Poor vim integration.
2. *Dendron*
This looks promising because it built as a VSCode plugin. This allows me to use other VSCode plugins like neovim for easier editing. Having a vim workflow is very encouraging.
3. *Roam*
Roam doesn’t suit my purpose because it has it’s own file extension and formatting. Doesn’t work well with static sites generator.

## A TODO app
I am not entirely sure if one would help. I do use a lot of TODO everyday to keep track of work. Maybe trying one would help?
