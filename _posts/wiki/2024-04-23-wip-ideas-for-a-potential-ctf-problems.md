## CTF Problem Ideas

### Something on vim
We know that `.lvimrc` is dangerous without the sandbox variable. Basically if you have the sandbox off, and you open a file in a location you don't trust (NFS drive?) the `.lvimrc` on that file will override your configuration can be used to steal some data out of you. make a CTF challange around it.

### A new OS
Since we have our own OS built, exploit something there?

### Write an exploitable program using C0 and exploit it.
C0 is developed by CMU, so exploit a program on it or the compiler developed for it.
