man pages!!
What a lovely discovery

* [Um â€“ Create your own man pages so you can remember how to do stuff - Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17797355) 
* [GitHub - sinclairtarget/um: Create and maintain your own man pages so you can remember how to do stuff](https://github.com/sinclairtarget/um) 
* [GitHub - pjungwir/manpj: Twenty years of tech notes, viewable as man pages](https://github.com/pjungwir/manpj/?tab=readme-ov-file) 



When you add your custom_man pages and you want them to work with `man -k`, you
just run `mandb` on the directory. So the appropos will be updated.


This is all so fun!!
