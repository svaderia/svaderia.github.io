[Lunr.js](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js) powers the search on this website.  
See this [https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/6307](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/6307).
Keep a track of this issue to see a replacement in future and a possibility of replacing it on this website.
I haven't use the search so much to see the performance decline.
