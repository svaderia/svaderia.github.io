# Projects

## Sarcasm Detection on Twitter dataset
<small>Feb 2017 - April 2017</small>  

Implemented a paper on Sarcasm Detection by A. Rajadesingan. 
Dataset was mined using **Twitter API**. **NLP** was scripted in Python using **nltk**.
Made some improvements and tweaks in **features** for the better results.
Applied various classification algorithms like **Ensemle, Naive Bayes classifier, SVM, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting,** etc.  
**Gradient Boosting** achieved an accuracy of **85.71%** from a feature set of only
**1\7<sup>th</sup>** the original size proposed in the paper.

## Energy Efficiency of Residential Building Design
<small>Jan 2017 - March 2017</small>  

Developed an **Android** application to predict the dependence of Energy
Efficiency, of a residential building in a particular area, based on its structure and
design. The energy efficiency is calculated in terms of the **Heating Load** and **Cooling Load** of the building which can further help to modify the building design for achieving maximum possible energy conservation in future. Achieved accuracy of **98%** using **Random Forest** algorithm.

## Fan Control System using 8086 Micro-Processor
<small>April 2017</small>

Designed a hardware system on **ISIS 2007**, **Proteus** to simulate the speed control and time settings for a DC Motor Fan using an **8086** 
Micro-Processor. An assembly script was used to run the model.
