BITS-ACM is an   ACM student chapter of BITS Pilani, consisting of 70+ Computer Science enthusiasts across all the years. BITS-ACM has been awarded Best student chapter in India for the past 4 consecutive years.  

My journey with BITS-ACM has been a remarkable one. It has played an impeccable role in shaping me as a team player and an innovator.
Most of my technical work for BITS-ACM deals with Machine Learning, but apart from that the major work also goes into organizing Hackathons / Workshops and Managing different events with team-mates.
The values of discipline, leadership, and responsibility were nurtured in me through BITS-ACM.

## National Service Scheme
<small>August 2015 - March 2016</small>  
<small>Position held: Volunteer</small>  

National Service Scheme (NSS) is an initiative by Government of India, with a primary focus on the development of personality of students through community service. NSS-Pilani now has more than 100 dedicated student volunteers working in the villages of Rajasthan to provide better educational and employment opportunities for the poor and the marginalized rural population.
As part of being a volunteer for the organization, I taught subjects like Math, Science and English to the students of nearby schools. To reinforce the learning and to make it more enjoyable I organized small fun activities that would help students grasp concepts easily.
