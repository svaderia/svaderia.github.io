# Internships
## Summer Research Internship at UST Global, Trivandrum
<small>May 2017 - July 2017</small>  

Worked on **Development of a decentralized firewall for malware detection using deep learning**.
Malware Detection engine was made using **Deep Belief Network (DBN)** and a decentralized firewall
system was developed using the **Ethereum blockchain** network.
Data of malware and benign files was modeled as **Grey-Scale images**, where each byte of a file was imagined as a greyscale pixel for the image construction.
**TensorFlow** was used to implement DBN. An accuracy of **89.9%** was achieved in the detection engine.   

I have published a research paper on this project, to know the details go to [**`Publications`**](/publications/)
